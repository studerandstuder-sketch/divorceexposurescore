      <h3>Premium Review (Optional but Recommended)</h3>
      <p class="muted">
        A Premium Marital Risk Analysis uses more of your personal information (e.g., the actual terms of your prenup/postnup and the law where you live; how you manage marital finances; how your real estate and business interests are titled; what your tax returns report). The Premium review goes deeper into your current system and what is available now. Keep in mind: anything available to you is generally available to a lawyer who might challenge your setup. With this first report, you see both strengths and weaknesses, and we recommend adjusting habits now before it becomes harder later—just like improving a credit score.

This increases the likelihood that equity would be divided equally if challenged. The fact that you cover most costs adds complexity, as it creates a mismatch between financial input and recognized ownership.",
